    <h2>Bubble Sort Algorithm</h2>
    <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> 
      Best Case: O(n), Average Case: O(n^2), Worst Case: O(n^2)<br>
      <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1)</p>    
      <h3>Educational Purposes</h3>
      <p>Bubble sort is frequently used in educational settings to teach sorting algorithms. Its simplicity makes it a good starting point for beginners to understand basic sorting concepts like comparisons and swaps.</p>

      <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
      <p>In very constrained environments where the number of elements to be sorted is small and computational resources are limited, bubble sort might find niche applications. This is rare, however, due to the availability of more efficient sorting algorithms even in embedded systems.</p>

      <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
      <p>Bubble sort is sometimes used in testing and debugging scenarios where simplicity and clarity of implementation are more important than efficiency. It can help in verifying the correctness of more complex sorting algorithms.</p>

      <h3>Historical Context</h3>
  <p>Bubble sort has historical significance as one of the earliest sorting algorithms studied. Understanding its principles and limitations can provide insights into the development and evolution of sorting algorithms.</p>
