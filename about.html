            <p>Algorithms are a fascinating use case for visualization. To visualize an algorithm, we donâ€™t merely fit data to a chart; there is no primary dataset. Instead, there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm visualizations are so unusual, as designers experiment with novel forms to better communicate. This is reason enough to study them.</p>
            <p>Visualization leverages the human visual system to <b>augment human intellect</b>; we can use it to better understand these important abstract processes, and perhaps other things, too.</p>

            <p>This project is undertaken by students of Cosmos College of Management and Technology as a part of a minor project to better understand algorithms and program the visualization tool necessary to do so.</p>
