Algorithm Visualization (AV) tools have become crucial aids in teaching algorithms to 
Computer Science (CS) students. However, existing AVs often fall short in providing a comprehensive understanding of algorithms beyond the application level due to their focus solely on visualizing algorithm steps. In response, this project proposes an extended approach to AV, termed Algorithm Visualization Tool (AVT), aimed at enhancing algorithm comprehension through case-based performance comparison. By integrating case-based performance comparison into the AVT, students can gain insights into the selection of algorithms based on specific problem scenarios, thereby advancing their understanding to higher cognitive levels. Additionally, the AVT adopts an evaluation-integrated development approach, prioritizing not only technical functionality but also usability. This project aims to contributes to bridging the gap between algorithm visualization and comprehensive algorithm understanding, paving the way for more effective algorithm education strategies.
