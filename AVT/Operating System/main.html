                Operating systems are critical for managing hardware and software resources, and two key aspects of this management include process scheduling and memory management. Scheduling ensures that CPU resources are allocated efficiently, while page replacement helps manage memory by handling data swapping between RAM and storage. These algorithms help optimize memory usage, preventing performance degradation in systems with limited memory.
                <br><br>
                Scheduling in operating systems ensures that multiple processes share the CPU effectively. Common scheduling algorithms include First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. Each algorithm decides the order in which processes access the CPU, balancing factors like response time and fairness. 
                <br><br>
                Page replacement is crucial for managing memory when there is limited RAM available. When a new page needs to be loaded but memory is full, page replacement algorithms decide which old page to remove. Common algorithms include Least Recently Used (LRU), First-In-First-Out (FIFO), and Optimal Page Replacement. LRU replaces the page that hasn't been used for the longest time, while FIFO removes the oldest page.
