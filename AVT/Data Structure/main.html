            <h2>Data Structure</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                Data structures play a fundamental role in how data is stored, processed, and retrieved. One of the most important operations performed on data structures is sorting, which arranges data in a particular order, making it easier to analyze and search.
                <br><br>
                Several sorting algorithms are used to handle data organization efficiently. These include Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Each of these algorithms has distinct time and space complexities, making them suitable for different applications based on the dataset's size and nature.
                <br><br>
                For instance, Bubble Sort is simple but inefficient for large datasets, while Merge Sort and Quick Sort offer better performance by utilizing divide-and-conquer strategies. Insertion Sort works well for small or nearly sorted datasets. These algorithms are useful in a variety of applications, such as organizing database records, improving the efficiency of search algorithms, and optimizing data retrieval processes in software applications.
