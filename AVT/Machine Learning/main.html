                Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without explicit programming. It relies on algorithms to model and analyze complex data patterns.
                These algorithms are essential in applications like predictive modeling, fraud detection, and recommendation systems in industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.
                <br><br>
                Some widely-used machine learning algorithms include Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These algorithms differ in complexity and the type of problems they solveâ€”ranging from simple predictive tasks to complex classification problems.
                <br><br>
                Linear Regression is a basic algorithm used for predicting continuous outcomes based on linear relationships between variables, making it suitable for tasks like sales forecasting or trend analysis.
