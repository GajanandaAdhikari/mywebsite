    <h2>Quick Sort Algorithm</h2>
    <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> 
      Best Case: O(n log n), Average Case: O(n log n), Worst Case: O(n^2)<br>
      <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(log n)</p>    
      <h3>Educational Purposes</h3>
      <p>Quick sort is an efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It is often faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms due to its small, constant factors and good cache performance.</p>

      <h3>Large Data Sets</h3>
      <p>Quick sort is often used for large datasets because of its average-case time complexity of O(n log n). It is also typically faster for smaller datasets compared to merge sort due to lower overhead.</p>

      <h3>Divide and Conquer</h3>
      <p>Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, which means it works by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems, solving them independently, and then combining their solutions.</p>

      <h3>Historical Context</h3>
  <p>Quick sort was developed by Tony Hoare in 1959 and has been widely used due to its efficiency and simplicity.</p>
